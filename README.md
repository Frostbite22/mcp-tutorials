# MCP Tutorials

A collection of tutorials and examples for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external systems and tools. It allows large language models (LLMs) to communicate with various services, access data, and perform actions outside their native environment.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains tutorials for implementing various MCP tools:

- [Weather Tool](tutorials/weather-tool.md) - Learn to build an MCP tool that fetches weather data
- [Outlook Integration](tutorials/outlook-tool.md) - Create an MCP tool that interfaces with Microsoft Outlook
- [Basic MCP Server](tutorials/basic-mcp-server.md) - Simple example of a working MCP server

## Getting Started
